new items to it and has sometimes that happens on purpose but  sometimes it just goes by accident and  by using the archive as a main resource for the programs i think we don't just showcase them as artifacts which often happens in a library but by doing this we also reflect on the past and we try to use our imagination and hopefully together we can shape new ideas for the future of an institution like worm the relation and what are some basic steps that you've been taking in your negotiations with worm we literally started from scratch i was an intern at that time and i was hired to assist the previous director and my internship lasted nine months during that period I've always been interested in all of the mess that was lying around there and the director a moment i think really enjoyed that mess was also creating it sometimes i think even got high on it he used it to make programs and it was for him away to get very productive but I didn't completely agree with it it was a shame that so many things were just catching dust or got damaged or simply got thrown away every time i get the chance to save something from the garbage there was basically no archive at that point just out of my own interest i started to make a database soon after i had an intern to assist me and i was really interested in the idea of setting up my own library he had in there because it was a lot of media which interested me maybe I got high on that  people must have noticed that around that time and so when the show up closed and the store was kind of dying asked me to think along with them about a public media library service to fill that gap 
illustrates the self-organizing history and the archive that also the relation with programming making events I think of myself not as a programmer but as someone who works together and asks people who are more specific to certain field we invite people to go in the archive and then do something we've been expanding building a book scanner never had an end goal in mind  we just want to open up the archive to a wider public but also service where we can copy things it is not that we make twenty copies of one item and then just spread them around in the building there are items often highlighted because of a program we made 
how can the public do something back for a collective like this
people can donate things if you think it is relevant and we archive muscle and you can participate in the events we have a series of events which is called food for thought we invite an artist to go in the archive and then get inspired by some of the things we have there and it gets translated into recipe the artist cooks we have a round the table with the item in the middle of the table and we discuss it what is being discussed is written down on the  back side of the recipe and it is archived for the future i see it as participative not just for ourselves to show something we want to influence this archive I was late copied things on a stick you can connect laptop open poster from a film control alt delete starring very trashy contains porno live for porno in the toilets recorded you can copy from my laptop after the talk don't tell anyone this is our own copyright fine someone came up to me and she said i would really like to do a food for thought event do you have that film and i didn't know anything about it because it was way before or around my time i started to look for it  digital archive old server more things were possible more regulations you can not have smoke machines smoke inside anymore can't throw an egg on the ground because dirty the floor manager gets mad everything was possible i wanna do something similar no please don't do that to me because people are going to kill me here the end because the cracks in the wall and that's the light shines through life on a crack the smoking room sandwiches with tempeh because catering during that event when the film was made it was Luna from the fucking bastards play two hours noise show and had smoking machine and they made it super dirty and even it was so nice that we did it again last month you can if you want you there is a small film just made it with my cellphone when we did in the smoking room I was looking for a trashy video but I did't have it
degree you could earn  parallel university idea was that you could go at school at worm workshops trained there aside from the real school which is maybe not so cool it inspired me for the pirate bay in that way that I am also volunteer  revolt a lot of my job as a programmer an archive operator and a volunteer coordinator so everyone was volunteering i also try to include them within our organisation not just have them selling tickets or checking for stamps at the door but also try to make their skills useful within the pirate bay  project so we run it on a community of  forty fifty volunteers and i hope everyone that is they're now working with us learn something from that parallel university in the past and pirate bay now 

I will say something about the connection of Leeszaal with the neighborhood official institutions or not  how the leeszaal started it's started with the decision of the city council to close all the neighborhoods libraries

and in my neighborhood this decision evoked a lot of protest with the political parties and  all the men and the banners but nothing helped the policy reasoning was less customers so it's better to have six big libraries in Rotterdam than twenty four small ones but to the neighborhood reasoning was one diminishment of the costumers maybe the result of  preceding the reductions of opening hours and collection for children short distance is very important and it is also a community center and it is a place where you meet people nd the neighborhood needs places where you can just meet people without an idea to have to meet people just you go there because you have to do something there and you meet people i know about that either by cutting social welfare look for other closings of community centers sport centers educational centers so but still the protest didn't help and maoris and i are social researchers but we also live there and we met each other at the opening of the small self organised library  in senior apartments in Rotterdam east and he gave a lecture about the economy of sharing and i gave a lecture about public room and public familiarity and so we decided to do something about the libraries in Rotterdam west and to explore the possibilities to create a new public space that might take the place of the library but not be a simple library but something new optimism that such a thing might be possible was based on the knowledge that the is a very ahead that has a long activist tradition according to all municipal monitors its a poor and unsafe disadvantaged neighborhood but with a lot of residents groups and small self-organisations like migrant groups women groups groups around gardens about squares children playgrounds what we did was we visited all the groups and we asked persons what functions and activities such a new place that we call it reading room should have and what they personally could contribute and from this this discussion we derived
five teams reading reading loud sharing learning and meeting and then we decided to organize a festival of a week with the first fifteen volunteers to test these teams social housing co-operation gave us for one montha place it was a hammam and also already for a long time being occupied and completely empty in to and a half weeks we made a kind of a reading room in it by asking everybody to bring something tables chairs books bookshelves and i asked the Somalian group to be there two hours a day to take all the... and they did it and we had our first thousand books and we asked a friend interior architect to make with all that stuff something that looks like a reading room and a nice place because one of our principal is it has to have quality so we needed a professional to make something that quality was important to have visitors of course and all kind of visitors but later on we saw that the quality also important to keep the volunteers  it's nice place and it's a good place
for everybody and you are proud of it and you are part of it another thing is that we didn't make a plan no policy plan no business plan not a plan because it is a volunteer project the only thing is that we are hundred people hundred persons of twenty different birth countries and formed from eighteen to seventy five till now we made it together and what it is we do not decide so what we do is to organise these things that are basic we wanted to have it five days the week open from ten to seven in the evening we wanted the books to be free but the collection to be a good collection people sometimes they bring books we get thousands a week but we save always three hundred of them because they are stinking or they are in a bad shape or it is so old nobody will be interested in it so those are the basic things but in the meantime we have six cultural programs that are just initiatives of a few people who organise it so no plans and no business plans too because there is no business plan for the Leeszaal we will always need money from ... you cannot make a business plan of Leeszaal after the festival we told the housing cooperation we stay 08.35 ////// and started to make the negotiations about the rent in the meantime we stayed. We live in a society of abundance of stuff but also abundance of people who want to create, contribute and to meet people. by speaking with all the different groups we  haev a very diverse volunteer group. it will strengthen. I was afraid it will be a woman scene. The basis is the diversity of the neighbourhood.
Self organization, as public domain, place to learn and work and a cultural center. we found out some other concepts that explain how we manage to keep the diversity of the neighbourhood. one concept is every day diplomacy. meeting different people is often mentioned by volunteer as an atractive quality  of working here. It can lead to impatience and misunderstandings diplomacy so we neglect suggestions to make general rules
humor and kindness are key to deal with different people and to focus on the common goals not of different feelings and meanings.

to give you some sort of idea of what the inside looks like we have twenty thousand books and giveaways thirty thousand books a year have about thirty thousand visitors a year what you get when you open a space five days a week  forty four weeks. autonomous space how do you relate to the institutions we started when the library closed we didn't want money fromthe municipality they closed libraries so why go back saying we wanna start something  some funding. but we still have to pay rent, pay for electricity we don't pay volunteers but there is money going around funded by everyone trying to become a millionaire sponsoring social and cultural projects. we approached him because they have a large program called new meeting spaces money could we be eligible for getting money. we realized they're probably gonna ask us how much money we're looking for so we come up with a  budget  

within six weeks we have fifty thousand euro and it was meant to last one year  we don't know what the reading room can be can you help us figure it out they were very open to this experimental question very a particular for fund most of them you want to know exactly what you gonna do what they will end up with here they didn't know just if we're gonna make a public space  we ran into another problem we couldn't spend the money which is a good thing so  realized  we're not gonna spend it no way  we spend seven percent wrote them saying well we have a problem it's a great way to start.
apply for more funding because social projects there is always need for third-party money. 

probably don't want us to send it back because your acccountant doesn't know how to book returned gifts that have ever found on so we sent to them well and maybe option should we spend as long as we need to spend the money given that we will do everything we propose to we're going to do so be public space for people could get books culture activities 
actually the motor for maintaining our space over a longer term of what it was only possible because spent less money than we talked at the beginning and were able to make money for renting out the space coffee and tea beer and wine at events.  we don't want money for being a space who want to be autonomous who want to keep the rules all the outside money comes with regulations we should skip rules or rules do not apply to us. last year we have a lot of trouble with troubled people alcohol language institutions most horrible
negotiations housing corporations people who need to spend one point eight million on literacy but don't know how to spend it in wise way language classes and we have strange negotiations a civil servant who says  no cultural social space can sell alcohol there's a prohibition on alcohol outside of cafes 
so you you see what happens autonomous you try to be hard work and make your own rules but if you do something in public space you will run in to the rules becomes hard work but don't run away from this fun to poke stretch the rules and maintain other regulations or see if the rules don't apply to you we're trying to figure out if we can become a space where you can actually alcohol without being a cafe it's actually fighting with national policy that's the fun part of being an autonomous space  you can make your own rules 

they've decided alcohol is a problem we have internal jokes part of islamisation and see if we can bend the rules 
we have four language classes every morning 
improving language is not important anymore city council but they don't know how to make programs learn crazy institutional ways of carving the world cooperation they know difficult schemes institutions  like to make the world very complex when it isn't 

we evolved into a neighborhood cooperative we've been working on this whole thing for over ten years so it's quite extensive
visual artist, south of Rotterdam the main focus the researching the relationship between production and public space and specifically we've been focusing on how we could stimulate local cultural production in the broadest sense imaginable and to give you  insight general figures on top of a few of those negative figures a lot of people depending on the benefits people are unemployed from migratory background social housing 

undergoing urban renewal projects middle class housing being built there gentrification initiate another type of development which would be more from within and making use of the existing qualities and values we started the series of projects tomorrow's market every wednesday and saturday booming heart of the neighborhoods bridge who would come to the south to to visit this market markets presentation of the products we thought that if you get you pay more attention to how you present products and they you pay more attention to the whole experience of this market than it could become this booming heart of the area situated in a very culturally diverse area small scale interventions within the existing market organized than five markets ourselves and all the interventions were based on a match between the market vender and an artist or designer equal collaboration co-production
not always a fun thing to do because vendors are not interested in art and a lot of artist were not expecting to work on the market which means be at seven in the morning also when it rains and it has to be ready at a certain time we did a lot of interventions with that redesigning stalls it was very interesting we learned a lot interesting connections between people looked into the classical meaning of the market a place for you could meet the other knowledge exchanges so not only products paid attention to presentation but also to this whole part of experience product development product innovation somebody proclaiming something on the market if you get to organize a fashion show market present a model is very different from

just hanging we added a new services to the market conflict because of the things that we were doing interventions prohibited under a ban on assembly this guy was singing without an amplifier  was not asking for money or anything but as soon as people it's an assembly and you are breaking the law within an art context it was took all the fines we got away with it fresh juice not allowed permit to sell oranges these regulations on the market and that was really restricting the creativity not all of them were ridiculous fire legislation place for assembly talking the authorities to get this through on but we never really found a solution government rules not enforcing them anymore talented people and we initiated a few of cooperative workspaces very productive  informal network that we wanted to make the connection between his choosing a newformal economy cooperative workspace with funding self sustainable making their own money and using a vacant kitchen textiles they work together in cooperative workspace
 really proud russian technique and the turkish technique look at an area we share our space with different groupscooperative work spaces the we like to see them as something that is part of the bigger thing in the whole area which neighborhood department store existing local shops neighborhood department store with the market match artists and designers visualisation of the products qualities values former pumping station it was renovated into a restaurant kitchen was empty so that's how we entered there actively programming the space as the house of values as a platform for local production and valuable outgrown the whole doing things said there were always suited the foundation being an art project and which is no real problem for ourselves but was the problem for other people shop management art institution group of artists so we decided that we decided to become a cooperative neighborhood became a member of this cooperative we try to combine share as much as possible and not only on cultural production but the money flows in the area lock flows of money in the area that we are a general cooperatives which means that we have the general assembly meetings there with all our members will be discussed at the future of the area difficult sometimes because it's a very diverse group of people some people were more experienced in having meetings people who have a lot on their minds effort in a shared interest and although they find it important but it's it's something extra difficult for us as an art institution and which is more easy since cooperative cleaning business which we started to because we noticed that a lot of money is being spent on cleaning in the area 
 bigger companies who are not the situated in the neighborhood so we decided cleaning business houses offices sustainable waste collection our position to than authorities because in this case we challenge to the city of Rotterdam waste collection to us would never separate the waste and we said we can also do it differently in the morning and then you can separate the waste big benefit 
less wasted neighborhood spread around the neighborhood and it saves a lot of money if you separate the waste employees reduction costs of separating the waste try to make that connection so they've been with the other groups as such investigating new kinds of products out of waste materials product development important to pay attention to what it means waste collector market look cool experts in their own fields and they are the ones that know how to do this and it's not the boss from a desk that that determine how to have to work on this process something that where we came into conflict with city because we said we want them to be a host we want them to be the ones to take care of public space and to be the host of this market the department who was taking care it's not our business because we don't take care paying for waste collectors never talked about it anymore study 
system of waste collection keep more money in in the area innovative fruit and vegetables are being thrown away the end of jam factory neighborhood waste materials we always have to explain why we are an art artistic develop  area tequal balance between beingeconomical the social and cultural and engine at the same time instalation balance different aspects that you meet experience if you if you work in an area like this

develop small the different thoughts and all about talking to a lot of people and that people from the area but also authorities and lots of love different than people we have to find way of communicating in them but also it's all connected neighborhood it's all connected important strong network within the area but also network outside networks together and is this is also with visualizing knitting networks strong tissue in the city 

transform city, a better place but never step to participate in the economy social cultural economical notice you didn't mention political decision on your part cooperative assembly finally i believe that if you try to make economic change against political force which stops tactics to beat we sometimes lose track of all political aspect and i think also find it very relieving because we can focus all our own agenda and not being met by any political agenda autonomous as a cooperative political boundaries there  stay in touch with our own agenda to talk about people take they close doors every political party handing out flyers on the market politics probably social programs familiar leading politicians clear political agenda he's not really interested in us because too autonomous can not control us collaborate frustrating  negative aspects wrong and that any positive aspects very nice 

employed people unemployed we cannot employ all of them but we do employ people and that's more than he can do so he is interested in that sense it's a difficult because we are working small scale for him 
organization connection in Rotterdam international everyone would be interested to start something is welcome we can host every everyone who's interested in in doing something 
 contributing development of the area it's an it's beneficial knowledge entrepreneurial welcome critical limits on the the scales of all we are extending others neighborhoods but there is there is a limit horizontal growth network in another neighborhood that you can connect it to be connected together but there's a scale on how many people you can know by yourself organization key figures of course when their own networks cells that that know each other and and as soon as the cells are connected to other cells it's productive organic program exchange of expertise everyone brings is it in his own expertise value positive the shops in the neighborhood with the design from the standpoint always people who don't like it business provide businesses catering business 
compete competition gentrification
normal inflation social housing shops more expensive

i like the waste management project systemic complex problem that really needed to sort of architectural design design approach graphic identity over designing quite diverse but in terms of the branding it it doesn't quite reflect that homogenize designers temporary branding neighborhood give examples to people to them to get them to pay more attention product of that temporary 

job we should not do participation society neo-liberal program public withdraws and private initiatives citizen initiatives has to take over all sectors and social sectors community activism organize something double feeling capitalism imperfection problem imperfection human shitty crappy do it yourself neo-liberalism
messy acceptable clean ugly beautiful stronger quality leo-liberalism make money projects different kind of quality uniting the people in neighborhoodsliving environment not a problem with it looks nice as long as we just think human action kindness 

react city council admire nice critical action cheap library discussion active journal challenge city council speak policy neighbourhood not good children popular books discussion children young discussion about the policy not enough 
use our position social projects to stay active politically position we have to fight against rules wrong path pick his fights fighting should be different when we showed it can be differently and then from that position is much more easy equal debate position for politics social story homeless people warm open public spaces care system volunteer public spaces for homeless people

care system thank you faith government job where my country i don't have faith in the government take certain jobs government's hands because they're not capable of doing it properly them at least where i'm from we have a crazy president right now so i think it's good sometimes to say maybe you don't know how to do your job and maybe 
autonomous way of doing things maybe we can do a better depends gentrification not gonna take your money and will find fascist specter leg over the western world now also for our side of the planet job away from the government and during a better you actually that's the way to get into the government 
counterpolitics perfect inspiring utopian future for your projects interested in any of them not about my future projects future in general often don't agree institution trying to give gas in the other direction this project was my way archive and making archive my own different scale their jobs are more like to see it as taking ourselves change that general atmosphere climates neo-liberal
