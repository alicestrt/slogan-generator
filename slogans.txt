  Better to squat than let homes rot
    stand up for your rights
    whatever they say squtting will stay
    take back the night
    squat the world
    reclaim the streets
    we are the 99%
    capitalism isn't working
    power is for the people
    time's up for the 1%
    freedom is never given
    you have the right to remain silent but I don't recommend it
    homes for all
    axe the housing act
    homes for people not for profit
    cap rents not housing benefit
    homes not borders
    we want houses now
    bring them here
    refugees welcome
    propwrty is theft
    homes not jails
    hands off the squats
    support the struggle
    when housing is a luxury, squatting is a necessity
    whatever they say squatting will stay
    fuck the law squat the world
    housing is a human right
    people over profit
    gentrification is class war
    open the borders
